# Jelly-JVM

Implementation of [Jelly](https://w3id.org/jelly), a super-fast RDF serialization format and streaming protocol, for Apache Jena, Eclipse RDF4J, and the [Titanium RDF API](https://github.com/filip26/titanium-rdf-api).

You can use Jelly-JVM simply as a "plain old" RDF file serializer/parser, just a very fast one.

But, this library also gives you the full stack of utilities for scalable RDF streaming with **[Jelly](https://w3id.org/jelly)** in a lot of different scenarios, including networking environments. You can only use a part of the stack (e.g., only the serializer), or you may choose to use the full gRPC server and the reactive streaming utilities.

### Plugin JARs

We also publish plugin JARs which allow you to use Jelly-JVM with [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/) and [RDF4J](https://rdf4j.org/) just by dropping the JARs into the classpath. You can find the JARs on the [releases page](https://github.com/Jelly-RDF/jelly-jvm/releases). **[More information about using the plugins](https://w3id.org/jelly/jelly-jvm/dev/getting-started-plugins/)**.
