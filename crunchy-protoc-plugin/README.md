# crunchy-protoc-plugin

`protoc` plugin generating highly optimized Java code. It's highly opinionated and works only for proto3. It's specifically designed for Jelly-JVM, but in principle it could be used for other projects as well.

The code here is based on the QuickBuffers project by HEBI Robotics: **https://github.com/HebiRobotics/QuickBuffers**

It was translated from Java to Scala, and then a lot of the code was restructured or removed.

There are also small parts of the code copied or inspired by Google's Protobuf project: **https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf**

Finally, the scalapb project also served as an inspiration for some of the code: **https://github.com/scalapb/ScalaPB**
